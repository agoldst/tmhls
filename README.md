This repository holds source code created by Andrew Goldstone and Ted Underwood for a project on topic-modeling the history of literary scholarship. We make it public so that others may, if they choose, rerun our analyses.

The R code depends on general-use functions found in a companion repository, [dfr-analysis](http://github.com/agoldst/dfr-analysis). Other researchers who wish to develop their own topic-modeling analyses may find the scripts in that repository more useful.

We are not able to release our source data, but we will supply the necessary JSTOR Data for Research queries on request. The topic models we generated are also available on request.

This repository's history has been edited to remove drafts of our forthcoming essay. A preprint version that essay, forthcoming in *New Literary History*, may be found at <https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/49323>.
